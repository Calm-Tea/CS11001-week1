            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>I am currently studying at the University of Dundee, and making this 'website' for a front end website
                development module</p>

            <p><strong>I don't like web</strong> in any shape or form, I'm hoping this module will change it at least a
                bit so I don't
                suffer for the next few years</p>

            <p>Not really going to write about myself just want to fill some space</p>
